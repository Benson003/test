        <p>In many moives, hackers are potrayed as badguys in moives or spies but in reality their efforts
            is important in mantaining security and preventing attacks.

            Hackers(<abbr title="Penetration-Testers" class="initialism">pentesters</abbr>)
            are the ones who test the security and ensure that are software,databases and networks are not vunrable to 
            attacks.
            Look at this example: <br> John builds and deploys  a chat app 
            users put in personal data and other important credentials. 
            John could wait for a black-hat hacker to hack his database of users' data and the hacker puts
            the data for sale on the dark web and also lose the respect of his users and buisness or he could get an ethical hacker to
            <abbr title="Penetration Test" class="initialism">pentest</abbr>
            his app and make sure users are safe by attacking the app and advicing John on the best line of action
            to secure his app.

            It is a very intresting job becuse it helps you to think creatively as diffrent systems will require diffrent
            ways of breaking them.<br>
            It can sometimes be a time-consuming job and does require patience because some hacks will take days,months
            and maybe even years but it is very satisfactory to be  able to know that you compromised a system(at least I feel that way).

                    <p class="card-text">It is the first stage in hacking. This involves diging up any information
                    one can find on the target from anywhere like google,youtube,facebook,instagram anywhere,
                    because this can prove to be valuable to as we go on because it can provide potential passwords or exploting
                    a known vulnerablity in such systems.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        This involves scanning the target system to find exploits or vulnerablities.
                        It is at this phase that we start to analyze the system from the outside like looking for open ports
                        or trying to exploit legtimate services like web port 80(HTTP) OR 443(HTTPS).

                    <p class="card-text">
                        This is when we finally through these exploits we gain user access into the 
                        system then from there we can pivot into other systems and connect to other internal systems.
                        As ethical hackers we are not permitted to alter,change or steal any data or important information.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        This is a stage where the attacker installs backdoors into the system so that
                        in future attacks th systems can easily be accessed. It is usally setup of a local
                        account or ganing passwords to already exsting superuser accounts or using an exploit tool to
                        create such access.

                        As any good hacker knows the most important thing is not to get caught.
                        A hacker is expected to remoove tracks  and traces of his attack using various methods.
                        It can involve hiding files in alternate data streams,hiding in pictures,maiuplating and
                        rewrting logs.

                        It involves documenting the process,tools and methods used in the attack,
                        the type of attack and possible solutions to the problem.
